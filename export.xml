                <![CDATA[All children, except one, grow up. They soon know that they will grow up, and the way Wendy knew was this. One day when she was two years old she was playing in a garden, and she plucked another flower and ran with it to her mother. I suppose she must have looked rather delightful, for Mrs. Darling put her hand to her heart and cried, "Oh, why can't you remain like this for ever!" This was all that passed between them on the subject, but henceforth Wendy knew that she must grow up. You always know after you are two. Two is the beginning of the end.

<!--more-->

Mrs. Darling first heard of Peter when she was tidying up her children's minds. It is the nightly custom of every good mother after her children are asleep to rummage in their minds and put things straight for next morning, repacking into their proper places the many articles that have wandered during the day.

If you could keep awake (but of course you can't) you would see your own mother doing this, and you would find it very interesting to watch her. It is quite like tidying up drawers. You would see her on her knees, I expect, lingering humorously over some of your contents, wondering where on earth you had picked this thing up, making discoveries sweet and not so sweet, pressing this to her cheek as if it were as nice as a kitten, and hurriedly stowing that out of sight. When you wake in the morning, the naughtiness and evil passions with which you went to bed have been folded up small and placed at the bottom of your mind and on the top, beautifully aired, are spread out your prettier thoughts, ready for you to put on.

I don't know whether you have ever seen a map of a person's mind. Doctors sometimes draw maps of other parts of you, and your own map can become intensely interesting, but catch them trying to draw a map of a child's mind, which is not only confused, but keeps going round all the time. There are zigzag lines on it, just like your temperature on a card, and these are probably roads in the island, for the Neverland is always more or less an island, with astonishing splashes of colour here and there, and coral reefs and rakish-looking craft in the offing, and savages and lonely lairs, and gnomes who are mostly tailors, and caves through which a river runs, and princes with six elder brothers, and a hut fast going to decay, and one very small old lady with a hooked nose. It would be an easy map if that were all, but there is also first day at school, religion, fathers, the round pond, needle-work, murders, hangings, verbs that take the dative, chocolate pudding day, getting into braces, say ninety-nine, three-pence for pulling out your tooth yourself, and so on, and either these are part of the island or they are another map showing through, and it is all rather confusing, especially as nothing will stand still.

Of course the Neverlands vary a good deal. John's, for instance, had a lagoon with flamingoes flying over it at which John was shooting, while Michael, who was very small, had a flamingo with lagoons flying over it. John lived in a boat turned upside down on the sands, Michael in a wigwam, Wendy in a house of leaves deftly sewn together. John had no friends, Michael had friends at night, Wendy had a pet wolf forsaken by its parents, but on the whole the Neverlands have a family resemblance, and if they stood still in a row you could say of them that they have each other's nose, and so forth. On these magic shores children at play are for ever beaching their coracles [simple boat]. We too have been there; we can still hear the sound of the surf, though we shall land no more.

Of all delectable islands the Neverland is the snuggest and most compact, not large and sprawly, you know, with tedious distances between one adventure and another, but nicely crammed. When you play at it by day with the chairs and table-cloth, it is not in the least alarming, but in the two minutes before you go to sleep it becomes very real. That is why there are night-lights.

Occasionally in her travels through her children's minds Mrs. Darling found things she could not understand, and of these quite the most perplexing was the word Peter. She knew of no Peter, and yet he was here and there in John and Michael's minds, while Wendy's began to be scrawled all over with him. The name stood out in bolder letters than any of the other words, and as Mrs. Darling gazed she felt that it had an oddly cocky appearance.]]>

                <![CDATA[Abbott: Strange as it may seem, they give ball players nowadays very peculiar names.

Costello: Funny names?

Abbott: Nicknames, nicknames. Now, on the St. Louis team we have Who's on first, What's on second, I Don't Know is on third--

Costello: That's what I want to find out. I want you to tell me the names of the fellows on the St. Louis team.

Abbott: I'm telling you. Who's on first, What's on second, I Don't Know is on third--

Costello: You know the fellows' names?

Abbott: Yes.

Costello: Well, then who's playing first?

Abbott: Yes.

Costello: I mean the fellow's name on first base.

Abbott: Who.

Costello: The fellow playin' first base.

Abbott: Who.

Costello: The guy on first base.

Abbott: Who is on first.

Costello: Well, what are you askin' me for?

Abbott: I'm not asking you--I'm telling you. Who is on first.

Costello: I'm asking you--who's on first?

Abbott: That's the man's name.

Costello: That's who's name?

Abbott: Yes.

Costello: When you pay off the first baseman every month, who gets the money?

Abbott: Every dollar of it. And why not, the man's entitled to it.

Costello: Who is?

Abbott: Yes.

Costello: So who gets it?

Abbott: Why shouldn't he? Sometimes his wife comes down and collects it.

Costello: Who's wife?

Abbott: Yes. After all, the man earns it.

Costello: Who does?

Abbott: Absolutely.

Costello: Well, all I'm trying to find out is what's the guy's name on first base?

Abbott: Oh, no, no. What is on second base.

Costello: I'm not asking you who's on second.

Abbott: Who's on first!

Costello: St. Louis has a good outfield?

Abbott: Oh, absolutely.

Costello: The left fielder's name?

Abbott: Why.

Costello: I don't know, I just thought I'd ask.

Abbott: Well, I just thought I'd tell you.

Costello: Then tell me who's playing left field?

Abbott: Who's playing first.

Costello: Stay out of the infield! The left fielder's name?

Abbott: Why.

Costello: Because.

Abbott: Oh, he's center field.

Costello: Wait a minute. You got a pitcher on this team?

Abbott: Wouldn't this be a fine team without a pitcher?

Costello: Tell me the pitcher's name.

Abbott: Tomorrow.

Costello: Now, when the guy at bat bunts the ball--me being a good catcher--I want to throw the guy out at first base, so I pick up the ball and throw it to who?

Abbott: Now, that's he first thing you've said right.

Costello: I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT!

Abbott: Don't get excited. Take it easy.

Costello: I throw the ball to first base, whoever it is grabs the ball, so the guy runs to second. Who picks up the ball and throws it to what. What throws it to I don't know. I don't know throws it back to tomorrow--a triple play.

Abbott: Yeah, it could be.

Costello: Another guy gets up and it's a long ball to center.

Abbott: Because.

Costello: Why? I don't know. And I don't care.

Abbott: What was that?

Costello: I said, I DON'T CARE!

Abbott: Oh, that's our shortstop!]]>

<blockquote>People think focus means saying yes to the thing you've got to focus on. But that's not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I'm actually as proud of the things we haven't done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things. <cite>Steve Jobs - Apple Worldwide Developers' Conference, 1997</cite></blockquote>

<strong>Delete Tag</strong>

This tag will let you <del>strikeout text</del>, but this tag is no longer supported in HTML5 (use the <code>&lt;strike&gt;</code> instead).

<strong>Emphasize Tag</strong>

The emphasize tag should <em>italicize</em> text.

                <![CDATA[Putting special characters in the title should have no adverse effect on the layout or functionality.

Special characters in the post title have been known to cause issues with JavaScript when it is minified, especially in the admin when editing the post itself (ie. issues with metaboxes, media upload, etc.).

                <![CDATA[<h2>Title should not overflow the content area</h2>

A few things to check for:
<ul>
	<li>Non-breaking text in the title, content, and comments should have no adverse effects on layout or functionality.</li>
	<li>Check the browser window / tab title.</li>
	<li>If you are a plugin or widget developer, check that this text does not break anything.</li>
</ul>

The following CSS properties will help you support non-breaking text.

<pre>-ms-word-wrap: break-word;
word-wrap: break-word;</pre>

                <![CDATA[<h3>Default</h3>
This is a paragraph. It should not have any alignment of any kind. It should just flow like you would normally expect. Nothing fancy. Just straight up text, free flowing, with love. Completely neutral and not picking a side or sitting on the fence. It just is. It just freaking is. It likes where it is. It does not feel compelled to pick a side. Leave him be. It will just be better that way. Trust me.
<h3>Left Align</h3>
<p style="text-align:left;">This is a paragraph. It is left aligned. Because of this, it is a bit more liberal in it's views. It's favorite color is green. Left align tends to be more eco-friendly, but it provides no concrete evidence that it really is. Even though it likes share the wealth evenly, it leaves the equal distribution up to justified alignment.</p>

<h3>Center Align</h3>
<p style="text-align:center;">This is a paragraph. It is center aligned. Center is, but nature, a fence sitter. A flip flopper. It has a difficult time making up its mind. It wants to pick a side. Really, it does. It has the best intentions, but it tends to complicate matters more than help. The best you can do is try to win it over and hope for the best. I hear center align does take bribes.</p>

<h3>Right Align</h3>
<p style="text-align:right;">This is a paragraph. It is right aligned. It is a bit more conservative in it's views. It's prefers to not be told what to do or how to do it. Right align totally owns a slew of guns and loves to head to the range for some practice. Which is cool and all. I mean, it's a pretty good shot from at least four or five football fields away. Dead on. So boss.</p>

<h3>Justify Align</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a paragraph. It is justify aligned. It gets really mad when people associate it with Justin Timberlake. Typically, justified is pretty straight laced. It likes everything to be in it's place and not all cattywampusÂ like the rest of the aligns. I am not saying that makes it better than the rest of the aligns, but it does tend to put off more of anÂ elitistÂ attitude.</p>]]>

                <![CDATA[Welcome to image alignment! The best way to demonstrate the ebb and flow of the various image positioning options is to nestle them snuggly among an ocean of words. Grab a paddle and let's get started.

On the topic of alignment, it should be noted that users can choose from the options ofÂ <em>None</em>,Â <em>Left</em>,Â <em>Right, </em>andÂ <em>Center</em>. In addition, they also get the options ofÂ <em>Thumbnail</em>,Â <em>Medium</em>,Â <em>Large</em>Â &amp;Â <em>Fullsize</em>.
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-906 aligncenter" title="Image Alignment 580x300" alt="Image Alignment 580x300" src="http://wpthemetestdata.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/image-alignment-580x300.jpg" width="580" height="300" /></p>
The image above happens to beÂ <em><strong>centered</strong></em>.

<strong><img class="size-full wp-image-904 alignleft" title="Image Alignment 150x150" alt="Image Alignment 150x150" src="http://wpthemetestdata.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/image-alignment-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" /></strong>The rest of this paragraph is fillerÂ for the sake of seeing the text wrap around the 150x150 image, which is <em><strong>left aligned</strong></em>.Â <strong></strong>

As you can see the should be some space above, below, and to the right of the image. The text should not be creeping on the image. Creeping is just not right. Images need breathing room too. Let them speak like you words. Let them do their jobs without any hassle from the text. In about one moreÂ sentenceÂ here, we'll see that the text moves from the right of the image down below the image inÂ seamlessÂ transition. Again, letting the do it's thang.Â Mission accomplished!

And now for a <em><strong>massively large image</strong></em>. It also has <em><strong>no alignment</strong></em>.

<img class="alignnone  wp-image-907" title="Image Alignment 1200x400" alt="Image Alignment 1200x400" src="http://wpthemetestdata.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/image-alignment-1200x4002.jpg" width="1200" height="400" />

The image above, though 1200px wide, should not overflow the content area. It should remain contained with no visible disruption to the flow of content.

<img class="size-full wp-image-905 alignright" title="Image Alignment 300x200" alt="Image Alignment 300x200" src="http://wpthemetestdata.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/image-alignment-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" />

And now we're going to shift things to the <em><strong>right align</strong></em>. Again, there should be plenty of room above, below, and to the left of the image. Just look at him there... Hey guy! Way to rock that right side. I don't care what the left aligned image says, you look great. Don't let anyone else tell you differently.

In just a bit here, you should see the text start to wrap below the right aligned image and settle in nicely. There should still be plenty of room and everything should be sitting pretty.Â Yeah... Just like that. It never felt so good to be right.

And just when you thought we were done, we're going to do them all over again with captions!

[caption id="attachment_906" align="aligncenter" width="580"]<img class="size-full wp-image-906  " title="Image Alignment 580x300" alt="Image Alignment 580x300" src="http://wpthemetestdata.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/image-alignment-580x300.jpg" width="580" height="300" /> Look at 580x300 getting some <a title="Image Settings" href="http://en.support.wordpress.com/images/image-settings/">caption</a> love.[/caption]

The image above happens to beÂ <em><strong>centered</strong></em>. The caption also has a link in it, just to see if it does anything funky.

[caption id="attachment_904" align="alignleft" width="150"]<img class="size-full wp-image-904  " title="Image Alignment 150x150" alt="Image Alignment 150x150" src="http://wpthemetestdata.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/image-alignment-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" /> Itty-bitty caption.[/caption]

<strong></strong>The rest of this paragraph is fillerÂ for the sake of seeing the text wrap around the 150x150 image, which is <em><strong>left aligned</strong></em>.Â <strong></strong>

As you can see the should be some space above, below, and to the right of the image. The text should not be creeping on the image. Creeping is just not right. Images need breathing room too. Let them speak like you words. Let them do their jobs without any hassle from the text. In about one moreÂ sentenceÂ here, we'll see that the text moves from the right of the image down below the image inÂ seamlessÂ transition. Again, letting the do it's thang. Mission accomplished!

And now for a <em><strong>massively large image</strong></em>. It also has <em><strong>no alignment</strong></em>.

[caption id="attachment_907" align="alignnone" width="1200"]<img class=" wp-image-907" title="Image Alignment 1200x400" alt="Image Alignment 1200x400" src="http://wpthemetestdata.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/image-alignment-1200x4002.jpg" width="1200" height="400" /> Massive image comment for your eyeballs.[/caption]

The image above, though 1200px wide, should not overflow the content area. It should remain contained with no visible disruption to the flow of content.

[caption id="attachment_905" align="alignright" width="300"]<img class="size-full wp-image-905 " title="Image Alignment 300x200" alt="Image Alignment 300x200" src="http://wpthemetestdata.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/image-alignment-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /> Feels good to be right all the time.[/caption]

And now we're going to shift things to the <em><strong>right align</strong></em>. Again, there should be plenty of room above, below, and to the left of the image. Just look at him there... Hey guy! Way to rock that right side. I don't care what the left aligned image says, you look great. Don't let anyone else tell you differently.

And that's a wrap, yo! You survived theÂ tumultuousÂ waters of alignment. Image alignment achievement unlocked!]]>

<h2>Blockquotes</h2>
Single line blockquote:
<blockquote>Stay hungry. Stay foolish.</blockquote>
Multi line blockquote with a cite reference:
<blockquote>People think focus means saying yes to the thing you've got to focus on. But that's not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I'm actually as proud of the things we haven't done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things. </blockquote>
<cite>Steve Jobs</cite> - Apple Worldwide Developers' Conference, 1997

<h2>HTML Tags</h2>
These supported tags come from the WordPress.com code <a title="Code" href="http://en.support.wordpress.com/code/">FAQ</a>.

<strong>Address Tag</strong>

<address>1 Infinite Loop
Cupertino, CA 95014
United States</address><strong>Anchor Tag (aka. Link)</strong>

This is an example of a <a title="Apple" href="http://apple.com">link</a>.

<strong>Abbreviation Tag</strong>

The abbreviation <abbr title="Seriously">srsly</abbr> stands for "seriously".

<strong>Acronym Tag (<em>deprecated in HTML5</em>)</strong>

The acronym <acronym title="For The Win">ftw</acronym> stands for "for the win".

<strong>Big TagÂ <strong>(<em>deprecated in HTML5</em>)</strong></strong>

These tests are a <big>big</big> deal, but this tag is no longer supported in HTML5.

<strong>Cite Tag</strong>

"Code is poetry." --<cite>Automattic</cite>

<strong>Code Tag</strong>

You will learn later on in these tests that <code>word-wrap: break-word;</code> will be your best friend.

<strong>Delete Tag</strong>

This tag will let you <del>strikeout text</del>, but this tag is no longer supported in HTML5 (use the <code>&lt;strike&gt;</code> instead).

<strong>Emphasize Tag</strong>

The emphasize tag should <em>italicize</em> text.

<strong>Insert Tag</strong>

This tag should denote <ins>inserted</ins> text.

<strong>Keyboard Tag</strong>

This scarcely known tag emulates <kbd>keyboard text</kbd>, which is usually styled like the <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> tag.

<strong>Preformatted Tag</strong>

This tag styles large blocks of code.
<pre>.post-title {
	margin: 0 0 5px;
	font-weight: bold;
	font-size: 38px;
	line-height: 1.2;
	and here's a line of some really, really, really, really long text, just to see how the PRE tag handles it and to find out how it overflows;
}</pre>
<strong>Quote Tag</strong>

<q>Developers, developers, developers...</q> --Steve Ballmer

<strong>Strike TagÂ <strong>(<em>deprecated in HTML5</em>)</strong></strong>

This tag shows <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">strike-through text</span>

<strong>Strong Tag</strong>

This tag shows <strong>bold<strong> text.</strong></strong>

<strong>Subscript Tag</strong>

Getting our science styling on with H<sub>2</sub>O, which should push the "2" down.

<strong>Superscript Tag</strong>

Still sticking with science and Isaac Newton's E = MC<sup>2</sup>, which should lift the 2 up.

<strong>Teletype TagÂ <strong>(<em>deprecated in HTML5</em>)</strong></strong>

This rarely used tag emulates <tt>teletype text</tt>, which is usually styled like the <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> tag.

<strong>Variable Tag</strong>

This allows you to denote <var>variables</var>.]]>

                <![CDATA[This is a sticky post.

There are a few things to verify:
<ul>
	<li>The sticky post should be distinctlyÂ recognizableÂ in some way in comparison to normal posts. You can style the <code>.sticky</code> class if you are using the <a title="WordPress Codex post_class() Function" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/post_class" target="_blank">post_class()</a> function to generate your post classes, which is a best practice.</li>
	<li>They should show at the very top of the blog index page, even though they could be several posts back chronologically.</li>
	<li>They should still show up again in their chronologically correct postion in time, but without the sticky indicator.</li>
	<li>If you have a plugin or widget that lists popular posts or comments, make sure that this sticky post is not always at the top of those lists unless it really is popular.</li>

                <![CDATA[This is the post content. It should be displayed in place of the auto-generated excerpt in single-page views. Archive-index pages should display an auto-generated excerpt of this content. Depending on Theme-defined filters, the length of the auto-generated excerpt will vary from Theme-to-Theme. The default length for auto-generated excerpts is 55 words, so to test the excerpt auto-generation, this post must have more than 55 words.

Be sure to test the formatting of the auto-generated excerpt, to ensure that it doesn't create any layout problems. Also, ensure that any filters applied to the excerpt, such as &lt;code&gt;excerpt_length&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;excerpt_more&lt;/code&gt;, display properly.]]>
